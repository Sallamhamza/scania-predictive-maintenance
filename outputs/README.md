# Outputs Directory

This directory contains the results generated by the Scania Predictive Maintenance analysis.

## Generated Files

After running the notebook, you'll find:

### 📊 **Association Rules**
- `association_rules.csv` - Complete list of discovered rules
  - Columns: antecedents, consequents, support, confidence, lift
  - Sorted by lift (strongest associations first)
  - 2,279 rows (maintenance-predicting rules)

### 📈 **Visualizations** (if saved)
- `figures/pca_scree_plot.png` - Principal component variance analysis
- `figures/association_network.png` - Rule relationship graph
- `figures/top_10_rules_chart.png` - Bar chart of best rules
- `figures/basket_heatmap.png` - Transaction-item matrix visualization

### 📁 **Intermediate Results** (optional)
- `X_pca.csv` - PCA-transformed features (74 components × 23,550 vehicles)
- `frequent_itemsets.csv` - All 49,209 discovered itemsets
- `basket_103_items.csv` - Filtered transaction matrix

## Usage

### Loading Results in Python

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load association rules
rules = pd.read_csv('outputs/association_rules.csv')

# View top 10 rules
print(rules.head(10))

# Filter by confidence
strong_rules = rules[rules['confidence'] > 0.8]
```

### Loading Results in Excel
1. Open Excel
2. File → Open → Select `association_rules.csv`
3. Sort by `lift` column (descending) to see strongest rules

## Notes

- Outputs are regenerated each time the notebook runs
- Large visualizations may take time to save
- CSV files use UTF-8 encoding
- `.gitignore` prevents committing large output files (only summaries are tracked)
